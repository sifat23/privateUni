Another key objective was to provide the training and opportunity to students and graduates for higher study abroad, either with a recognized degree or with transfer credits from NSU. This institution has been able to accomplish much of these intents and constantly strives to make the procedures more effective. \r\n\r\nThe university has grown rapidly and currently has 22,000 students. NSU graduates and students have obtained admission, often with financial aid, at renowned foreign universities, such as Harvard, UPenn, Cornell, University of Texas-Austin, Syracuse University, University of Virginia, York University (Canada), University of British Columbia, Windsor University, Indiana University of Pennsylvania, University of Wyoming, and other institutions of higher learning in the US, Canada, UK, Holland and Australia.\r\n\r\nThe NSU faculty members, with degrees from foreign universities, over 80% from North America, are collectively the most qualified cluster of teachers in any university in Bangladesh. Each year, young faculty members receive admission with fellowship in distinguished foreign universities in North America, Australia and the UK to pursue PhD Degree under the NSU Study Leave program. \r\n\r\nStudent and faculty exchange with reputable overseas universities is of vital NSU interest, to keep updated curriculum and teaching methodology in place and learn the latest techniques from institutions of higher learning abroad.
